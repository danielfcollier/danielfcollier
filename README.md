### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a CRM project for a medical clinic. 

It is a cloud-based project for database management, business automation, file backup system, payment service through API, and business report automation.

The stack is composed of:
- Apps Script: for cloud-based software with cron jobs
- Google Sheets: for user interface and database
- Google Drive: for files and database
- Gmail: for email service
- Google Docs: for file system

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **backend** with Node.js and **cloud fundamentals** in AWS.
