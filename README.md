# Senior Software Engineer

I build backend systems that serve both customer-facing products and internal platforms. I design and operate distributed systems - from provisioning engines and lifecycle managers to cloud-native APIs that power reliable product experiences at scale. Currently building DBaaS products with Python/FastAPI, RabbitMQ, and PostgreSQL. Background in Electrical Engineering (M.Sc.) with early roots in software (Linux, Python, Java, 2004). I'm actively building AI-integrated applications, from real-time ML inference on edge devices to LLM orchestration tools, applying the same backend engineering rigor to AI-powered systems.
