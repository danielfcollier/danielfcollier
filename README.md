# Senior Platform Engineer (M.Sc.)

> "Building the control planes that power critical infrastructure."

I am a **Senior Platform Engineer** specializing in **Reliability (SRE)**, **Internal Developer Platforms (IDP)**, and **Energy Systems**.

My background combines **M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering** (Power Systems & Control Theory) with 15+ years of software engineering. I apply rigorous **Control Theory** principles—feedback loops, state convergence, and stability analysis—to build self-healing cloud platforms for high-stakes environments.

## ⚡ The Intersection: Platform + Physics
I view infrastructure as a dynamic system that must be observed and controlled.
- **Platform Engineering**: Architecting Internal Developer Platforms (IDP) that standardize and automate the lifecycle of stateful workloads.
- **Reliability Engineering**: Designing **Kubernetes Operators** and **Control Planes** that treat infrastructure as code that converges to a desired state.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

**Platform & Automation**
- **Languages**: Python (Expert - Automation/FastAPI), Go (System Tools), Bash.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (Operators/CRDs), OpenStack, Terraform (Provider Dev), Crossplane.
- **Observability**: Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, SLI/SLO Design.
- **Architecture**: Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), MQTT, Microservices.
- **GitOps**: ArgoCD, Flux.

**Energy & Critical Systems**
- **Simulation**: MATLAB/Simulink, Python (SciPy/NumPy), Grid2Op.
- **Domain**: Power Processing Systems, Smart Grid, EV Charging, Virtual Power Plants (VPP).

## 🚀 Projects & PoCs

**1. Virtual Battery Operator**
- **Goal**: A Kubernetes Operator written in Go that manages VirtualPowerPlant Custom Resources.
