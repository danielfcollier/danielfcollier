# Senior Systems Engineer | Cloud & Energy Specialist (M.Sc.)

> "Applying Control Theory to the Cloud, and Cloud Architecture to the Grid."

I am a **Senior Systems Engineer** specializing in the intersection of **Energy Systems**, **Reliability Engineering**, and **Cloud Native Architecture**.

My background is unique: I hold an **M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering** and have spent the last decade building **self-healing cloud systems**. I am now focused on applying these distributed system patterns to physical challenges in **EV Charging**, **Smart Grids**, and **Virtual Power Plants**.

## ⚡ The Intersection: Grid + Cloud

I approach software engineering with a Systems Modeling mindset.

- **Cloud Orchestration**: I build self-healing systems (Python) that behave like closed-loop control systems - monitoring state and converging to desired setpoints.
- **Reliability**: I apply "Software-in-the-Loop" (SIL) and formal verification methods to infrastructure automation.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

**Cloud & Automation**
- **Languages**: **Python** (Expert - Automation/Backend), Go (Tooling/Terraform), Bash.
- **Platform**: OpenStack, Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform (Provider Contributor).
- **Architecture**: Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), MQTT, Microservices.
- **Observability**: Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry.

**Energy & Modeling**
- **Simulation**: MATLAB/Simulink, Python (SciPy/NumPy), **Grid2Op**.
- **Domain**: Wind Energy (WECS), Power Electronics (PMSG), Microgrid Control, Optimal Power Flow.

## 🚀 Projects & PoCs

**1. Edge AI Acoustic Fault Detector** (Active)
- **Goal**: Detect motor anomalies using high-frequency audio analysis at the edge.
- **Stack**: Raspberry Pi 4, Python, TensorFlow Lite, MQTT.
- **Status**: View Roadmap

**2. Cloud Control Loop: Infrastructure as State Machines** (Demo)
- **Goal**: Demonstrate self-healing cloud logic using deterministic State Machines (FSM).
- **Stack**: Python, Control Theory Patterns.
- **Concept**: Applies PID-like convergence to infrastructure resources, mirroring the logic used in high-reliability control planes.

**3. Smart Grid Operations with Grid2Op** (Planned)
- **Goal**: Apply Reinforcement Learning concepts to power grid topology management using the grid2op framework.
- **Focus**: Automating grid resilience against cascading failures.

## 📜 Selected Research & Honors

- **Innovation Award (1st Place)**: Awarded by **WEG Electric Corp.** for "Technological Innovation" in Motor Control.
- **Paper**: Modeling & Control of WECS: My most cited work on the non-linear dynamics of Wind Energy Conversion Systems.
- **Paper**: AC Currents Synchronization Technique Based on the Normalized Phase-Locked Loop for Modulation of a Three-Phase PWM Delta-Switch Rectifier: Cited by a US Patent (2021), demonstrating long-term industrial relevance for grid synchronization.
- **Patent Holder**: Co-inventor of " Current Self-Control Applied to Three-Phase Electric Generators Connected to Three-Phase PWM Rectifiers".
